 * Work of breathing, joules per minute — the Otis, Fenn & Rahn (1950) decomposition.
 *
 * Each breath costs ELASTIC work stretching the lung against its compliance, and RESISTIVE work
 * driving gas through the airways. They pull in opposite directions with respiratory rate, which
 * is the whole reason the quantity is worth showing: big slow breaths are cheap on resistance and
 * expensive on elastance, rapid shallow ones the reverse, and every patient has a rate that
 * minimises the total. Disease moves that optimum — obstruction toward slow and deep, stiff lungs
 * toward rapid and shallow — which is why the breathing PATTERN of a respiratory patient is
 * diagnostic rather than incidental.
 *
 * Elastic work per breath is the triangle under the pressure-volume line, Vt^2 / 2C. Resistive
 * work is the pressure needed to drive mean inspiratory flow, R * V̇, moved through Vt. Volumes
 * arrive in mL and compliance in mL/cmH2O; the 1e-3 * 0.098 converts cmH2O·L to joules.
