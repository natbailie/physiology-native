 * A two-compartment lung. Unit A is healthy; unit B carries whatever dead space or shunt has
 * been dialed in.
 *
 * The distinction is the point of the whole model:
 * - DEAD SPACE is ventilated but not perfused (V/Q → infinity), as in pulmonary embolism.
 * - SHUNT is perfused but not ventilated (V/Q → 0), as in pneumonia or atelectasis.
 *
 * And HPV can only help ONE of them. It diverts blood away from poorly ventilated lung, which
 * is exactly the shunt problem — so it partially compensates there. Against dead space it is
 * useless: the blood has already left that unit, and there is no perfusion to redirect. That
 * asymmetry is why shunt and dead space behave so differently despite both being "V/Q mismatch".
