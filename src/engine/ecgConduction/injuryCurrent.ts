/**
 * ST deviation from an ischemic injury current, mV.
 *
 * Ischemic myocardium cannot hold a normal resting potential, so a current flows between
 * injured and healthy tissue whenever the healthy tissue is NOT depolarised. The recorder
 * treats the resulting offset as the baseline, so the deflection actually shows up during the
 * ST segment — the window when healthy myocardium is uniformly depolarised and everything
 * would otherwise be isoelectric.
 *
 * Because the offset is a vector projected onto each lead like any other, both LOCALISATION
 * and RECIPROCAL CHANGE fall out for free. An inferior injury elevates ST in the inferior
 * leads (II, III, aVF) and simultaneously depresses it in aVL, because that lead faces the
 * other way. An anterior injury elevates V2 to V4 and leaves the limb leads comparatively
 * quiet. And a POSTERIOR injury — which no electrode faces directly — appears only as its own
 * mirror image: ST depression with tall R waves in V1 and V2. That last one is the classic
 * miss, and here it is a consequence of the geometry rather than a special case.
