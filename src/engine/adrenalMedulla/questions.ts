      'Palpitations and panic dominate when the tumour secretes adrenaline — the beta-heavy mix acts on the heart while adding only modest alpha vasoconstriction. Compare with the noradrenaline pattern: sustained pallor and pressure with a comparatively quiet pulse. The secretion mix is the phenotype, which is why the ten-percent rule told surgeons where the adrenaline-making tumours would sit.',

      'Noradrenaline works on alpha: weeks of vasoconstriction hold MAP high and leak plasma volume down until standing produces a marked drop.

      'Beta-blockade removed beta2 vasodilatation and left alpha vasoconstriction unopposed — so the same tumour now generates a higher MAP than no treatment at all.
