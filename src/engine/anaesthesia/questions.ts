      'The alveolar level relaxes toward the new ceiling: a higher dial delivers more agent at the Y-piece, more reaches the alveoli after the same wash-in, and the monitor climbs until it sits on a higher plateau. The wash-in time is unchanged, so the climb has the same shape as the earlier one, just pointed at a different ceiling — which is exactly why stepping the dial up feels "faster" than turning it on once, when the circuit starts empty.',

    explanation:
      'Nothing is removed from the patient; the circuit is simply filled with fresh gas that carries no agent, and the alveolar level falls along the same exponential that once raised it. High fresh gas flow makes the slope steep and the wake quick — the flush valve IS the pharmacokinetics, applied with a knob.

    explanation:
      'The blood:gas partition coefficient literally sets the speed limit: halothane dissolves into the blood far more readily, so the sink is bigger and the wash-in crawls; desflurane barely dissolves, the sink stays small, and the same curve reaches 90% in a fraction of the time. This is the single most examined concept in volatile anaesthesia — one number on a bottle label, and it predicts every induction you will ever watch.',

      'At a low fresh gas flow the patient re-breathes a larger share of the gas, and the re-breathed gas was half used already: the effective inspired concentration at the Y-piece falls even though the dial never moved. This is why "two percent on the dial" stops being true on low flow — the inspired fraction reading is the remedy for that particular lie, and it drops by a clear step here.',

    explanation:
      'Agent absorption is roughly solubility times cardiac output times what is already in the alveoli. The high-output patient presents more blood to the lung gas per minute, so more agent leaves the gas and enters the body with every pass — the same dial, a bigger extraction. It is the same arithmetic as a sponge in a running tap: the flow rate does the work, which is why output matters as much as the setting.',

That is the whole trick of a smooth induction — a high fresh gas flow during the first minutes is what "charging the circuit" means, and the dial alone cannot do it. The learner sees the clock on the wash-in move, not the dial.',
