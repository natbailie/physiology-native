/**
 * Interstitial hydrostatic pressure as a function of how full the interstitium is.
 *
 * Normal interstitial pressure is NEGATIVE — about −3 mmHg — because the lymphatics hold the
 * tissue slightly suctioned. That negative pressure is what keeps tissues compacted, and in the
 * lung it is what keeps the alveoli dry.
 *
 * The curve has two phases. While fluid is still bound in the gel matrix, the tissue is stiff
 * and pressure rises steeply with volume — this back-pressure is the single largest safety
 * factor against oedema, worth around 7 mmHg. Once the gel is saturated, free fluid appears,
 * compliance becomes enormous, and pressure barely rises however much more arrives. That is why
 * oedema seems to appear all at once: nothing visible happens until the gel is full, and then
 * everything happens.
