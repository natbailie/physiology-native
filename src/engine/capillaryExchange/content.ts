        'A note on the name first, because it causes real confusion: this is Ernest Starling\'s law of the CAPILLARY, and it has nothing to do with the Frank-Starling relationship between cardiac preload and stroke volume. Same physiologist, two different laws. The one here says that fluid movement across a capillary wall is driven by four pressures: Jv = Kf · [(Pc − Pi) − σ(πc − πi)]. Two push fluid out — capillary hydrostatic pressure, and the oncotic pressure of protein already in the tissue. Two hold it in — interstitial hydrostatic pressure, and the oncotic pressure of plasma protein.',
        'In a normal capillary these very nearly cancel. Capillary pressure is about 17 mmHg, interstitial pressure is negative at about −3, plasma oncotic pressure is 28 and interstitial oncotic pressure is 8. Net filtration pressure comes to roughly a third of a millimetre of mercury: about 2 mL/min leaves the circulation, and the lymphatics return exactly that much. Along the length of the capillary, pressure falls, so the arteriolar end filters and the venular end reabsorbs — the same equation, evaluated at two places.',

        'Which force is disturbed decides the diagnosis. Raise capillary pressure and you get cardiac or venous oedema. Lower plasma oncotic pressure and you get nephrotic or hepatic oedema. Raise permeability — that is, raise Kf, or lower σ — and you get the oedema of sepsis, burns and inflammation. Block the drainage and you get lymphoedema. There is no separate theory for any of these; there is one expression with four terms and two coefficients.',

        'The reflection coefficient σ is the term most often forgotten, because it is not a pressure. It measures how completely the wall reflects protein: at 1 the full oncotic gradient is exerted, at 0 protein crosses as freely as water and the oncotic term does nothing at all whatever the albumin level. This is why infusing albumin helps a nephrotic patient and fails a septic one — and it is why the hepatic sinusoid, whose σ is close to zero, produces ascites from hydrostatic pressure alone.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Oedema is also slower to appear than the equation suggests, because three safety factors absorb about 17 mmHg of extra capillary pressure before anything shows. The interstitial matrix is stiff while fluid is still bound in its gel, so pressure rises steeply and pushes back. The filtered fluid is nearly protein-free, so it dilutes the interstitial protein and weakens the force pulling fluid out. And the lymphatics can increase their flow around twentyfold. Only when all three are exhausted does free fluid appear — which is why oedema seems to arrive suddenly rather than gradually, and why it pits once it does.',

        'Those safety factors differ enormously between tissues, and that is what the tissue bed selector is for. The lung has a strongly negative interstitial pressure keeping the alveoli dry but only a fourfold acute lymphatic reserve, so pulmonary oedema appears once capillary pressure approaches the plasma oncotic pressure — around 25 mmHg. The liver has the smallest reserve of all and sinusoids that barely reflect protein. And the glomerulus is the same four forces arranged so that filtration never reverses: σ is 1, the filtrate is protein-free, capillary pressure is held high by the efferent arteriole, and what a systemic capillary does at 2 mL/min, this one does at 125.',
