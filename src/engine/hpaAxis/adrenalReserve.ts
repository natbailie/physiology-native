/**
 * Integrates adrenal functional reserve for one tick. While exogenous glucocorticoid is above
 * the suppression threshold, sustained ACTH suppression slowly atrophies the gland — and ONLY
 * atrophies it: real regrowth needs the ACTH signal that's exactly what's being suppressed, so
 * recovery is gated to only happen once suppression lifts (rather than the two competing
 * continuously, which would just settle at a partial-depletion equilibrium and never reach the
 * "fully atrophied" state a prolonged course produces). Recovery is deliberately slower than
 * atrophy — this asymmetry is what makes abrupt steroid withdrawal dangerous even after ACTH
 * itself has recovered.
