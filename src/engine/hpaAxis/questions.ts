Recovery needs ACTH stimulation, which was exactly what the steroid was suppressing, and regrowth runs far slower than the atrophy did. That asymmetry is the whole danger: the patient is left with neither source of cortisol for a period measured in weeks. It is why steroids are tapered rather than stopped, and why a patient mid-taper can still fail to mount a response to acute stress.',
