/**
 * Two beds, one ceiling between them.
 *
 * They were chosen to be the pair that asks the same question from opposite ends: what does
 * this heart do at its limit, and what does it do at rest. One collapses because demand
 * exceeds supply; the other barely needs to beat because supply arrives in bucketfuls — and
 * both are routinely misread as pathology in the wrong direction. Nothing here is new
 * physiology; what is new is that the numbers belong to somebody, which is the difference
 * between reading a panel and deciding what to do next.
 *
 * Observations are absent on purpose. `chart` points at `EFFORT_PANEL`, so the six rows are
 * read off the settled engine at the bedside and checked against it in `cases.test.ts`.

She needs reassurance and a corrected referral, not a device. Contrast Callum, whose high numbers at low workloads mean a ceiling, where hers at rest mean headroom.',
