    explanation:
      'A flat VO2 while effort continues is the definition of VO2max: demand exceeds supply and the difference is paid anaerobically, so lactate and fatigue climb together. The ceiling, not the workload, now sets the limit — which is why the test ends when VO2 plateaus rather than when the subject stops pedalling. Training raises this ceiling; nothing on the day of the test does.',

      'At identical absolute load, training shows up as a smaller fraction of the personal ceiling: lower heart rate, right-shifted lactate threshold, comfortable ventilation for the trained subject. The unfit one is above their threshold and paying anaerobically at the same watts. Absolute workloads mean nothing without knowing whose ceiling you compare against — percentage of VO2max is what the body actually senses.',

      'Training enlarges stroke volume, so the same cardiac output arrives in fewer, bigger beats — resting bradycardia reflects an efficient pump, not a failing one.
