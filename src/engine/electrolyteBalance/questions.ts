      'It falls, but barely any of it leaves in the vomit. The losses are renal: the volume depletion raises aldosterone, and the metabolic alkalosis both drives potassium into cells and increases distal secretion, so the kidney wastes potassium into the urine while the patient is losing it from above.

    explanation:
      'It falls, by roughly 8 mEq/L, and no sodium has gone anywhere. Without insulin glucose cannot enter cells, so it sits in the ECF as an effective osmole and holds water there. Water leaves the cells until both sides are iso-osmolar again — watch the ICF shrink and the ECF expand by the same volume while total body water does not move at all. The sodium is diluted by water that was previously intracellular.

      'It barely moves — which is the whole point of calculating it. The measured sodium fell because water moved, not because sodium was lost, so adding back the ~1.6 mEq/L per 100 mg/dL of glucose above normal recovers the sodium the patient would have had all along. A corrected sodium near 140 says this is not a sodium disorder and needs no sodium treatment; correct the glucose and the water goes back into the cells on its own. Had the corrected value come back low, there would be a genuine hypotonic hyponatraemia hiding underneath the hyperglycaemia — a different patient with a different treatment.
