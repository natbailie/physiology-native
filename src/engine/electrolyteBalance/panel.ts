/**
 * The hyponatraemia workup, in the order it is actually done.
 *
 * The serum sodium is on the panel and is deliberately near-useless: all three causes below
 * produce almost the same number, which is exactly the clinical problem. Volume status and
 * urine osmolality are what separate them, and that is the whole algorithm.
 *
 * A leaf file with type-only imports, and that matters: `questions.ts` pulls values out of
 * the engine, so a case file importing this panel from THERE would drag the whole electrolyte
 * engine into the ward-round index that loads on the home page. Both consumers read it here
 * instead, which also means the rows a learner is examined on are the rows the bedside shows
 * them — one definition, not two that agree until somebody edits one.
