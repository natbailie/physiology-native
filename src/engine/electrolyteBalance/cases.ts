/**
 * Three beds, one sodium between them.
 *
 * They were chosen to be the three causes that produce almost the same serum number and are
 * treated in opposite directions — water restriction, saline, and stopping the intake — which
 * is the whole reason the hyponatraemia workup exists, and the reason the panel carries
 * volume status and urine osmolality rather than sodium alone. Nothing here is new
 * physiology; what is new is that the number belongs to somebody, which is the difference
 * between reading a panel and deciding what to do next.
 *
 * Observations are absent on purpose. `chart` points at `SODIUM_PANEL`, so the four rows are
 * read off the settled engine at the bedside and checked against it in `cases.test.ts`.

She looks neither dehydrated nor oedematous, her pressure is steady, and she takes no diuretic. The laboratory reports a low sodium, and the house officer is already writing up a litre of normal saline on the grounds that low sodium means give sodium.',

Saline would be excreted as concentrated urine while the water stayed — the sodium number barely moving while the patient gains volume they do not need. This is the bed where fluid restriction, not infusion, is the treatment, and the exact opposite of Edna two beds down, whose identical sodium wants saline and nothing else.

Her ADH is entirely appropriate — faced with a choice between defending volume and defending tonicity, the body defends volume every time and accepts the low sodium as the price. So saline here is not a mistake but the treatment, and withholding it out of a misremembered rule would leave her under-resuscitated. Read the volume, not the sodium.',
