        'Serum potassium is not a measure of body potassium. Only about 1.4% of the body\'s potassium is in the extracellular fluid — roughly 55 mEq out of 4000 — so shifting a few percent of the intracellular pool across cell membranes transforms the serum level while total body potassium does not change at all. Insulin and beta-2 agonists drive potassium into cells, acidaemia drives it out, and hypertonicity drags it out with departing water. None of these move a single milliequivalent into or out of the body. The two traces plotted together here diverge for exactly this reason, and when they diverge, the serum level is lying about the deficit.',

        'Diabetic ketoacidosis is the case that punishes forgetting this. Insulin deficiency and acidaemia have pushed potassium out of cells, so the serum level reads high or normal, while osmotic diuresis has been stripping potassium out of the body for days. Give insulin and the reading collapses, because it was never measuring stores. The corollary is that treating hyperkalaemia with insulin or salbutamol buys time without removing any potassium; only a diuretic, a binder or dialysis does that.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Serum sodium is not a measure of body sodium either — it is a measure of water. The Edelman relation makes this explicit: serum sodium is exchangeable sodium plus exchangeable potassium, divided by total body water. Sodium content sets ECF volume; water content sets concentration. So a hyponatraemic patient can be volume-depleted, euvolaemic or oedematous, and the treatment differs completely in each case. Note also that potassium sits in the numerator: replacing potassium in a depleted patient raises their serum sodium without any sodium being given.',

        'Which is why the bedside algorithm goes tonicity, then volume, then urine. Tonicity first, because glucose or another effective osmole can dilute sodium with nothing wrong with water handling at all. Then volume status, because it separates the two commonest causes of a truly low sodium. In SIADH, ADH is secreted regardless of osmolality, the patient stays euvolaemic, and the treatment is water restriction. In hypovolaemia, ADH is high for an entirely appropriate reason — the body defends circulating volume ahead of tonicity — and the treatment is saline. Identical sodium, opposite management, and only the volume assessment tells them apart.',

      paragraphs: [
        'The kidney excretes potassium by SECRETING it distally, not by filtering it, so excretion is the product of three things: aldosterone, distal flow, and the serum level driving the gradient. That structure explains nearly every potassium disorder. Lose aldosterone (Addison\'s, spironolactone) and potassium rises. Lose distal flow (oliguria, severe volume depletion) and it rises. Add too much flow (loop and thiazide diuretics) and it falls. The transtubular potassium gradient asks whether the kidney is responding correctly or causing the problem — high in appropriate excretion, inappropriately low in renal failure.',

        'Finally, the rate of correction can matter more than the disorder. A brain that has been hyponatraemic for a day or more has exported organic osmolytes to avoid swelling, and it takes about a day and a half to get them back. Raise the sodium faster than that and the cells shrink catastrophically — osmotic demyelination, an injury caused entirely by the treatment. The danger tracks the rate and the level the brain has adapted to, never the sodium on the chart. A sodium of 110 corrected at 6 mEq/L per day is safe; the same sodium corrected at 20 is not.',
