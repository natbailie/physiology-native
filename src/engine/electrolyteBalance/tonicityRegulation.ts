 * ADH secretion. Two independent stimuli compete, and which one wins explains most of the
 * confusion around hyponatraemia.
 *
 * The osmotic stimulus is exquisitely sensitive — a 1% rise in tonicity changes ADH measurably —
 * and it is the one that should switch ADH OFF when serum sodium falls. The non-osmotic
 * (baroreceptor) stimulus is insensitive until volume falls by about 10%, but once engaged it
 * overrides osmolality completely. A hypovolaemic patient therefore keeps retaining water while
 * their sodium falls: the body defends circulating volume ahead of tonicity, and the
 * hyponatraemia is the price. That is a correct decision by the kidney, not a malfunction.
