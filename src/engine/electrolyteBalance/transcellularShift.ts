/**
 * Where potassium sits relative to the cell membrane — expressed as the ECF's share of total
 * body potassium, normally about 1.4%.
 *
 * Because that share is so small, moving a few percent of the intracellular pool across the
 * membrane transforms the serum level while total body potassium does not change by a single
 * milliequivalent. This is why the serum potassium is such an unreliable guide to potassium
 * STORES, and why the treatments that work fastest in hyperkalaemia — insulin, salbutamol —
 * fix the number without removing any potassium from the body at all.
 *
 * Insulin and beta-2 agonists stimulate the Na+/K+-ATPase and drive potassium IN. Acidaemia
 * drives it OUT as hydrogen ions are buffered intracellularly in exchange. Hypertonicity drags
 * it out with the water leaving the cell.
