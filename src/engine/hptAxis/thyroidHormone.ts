 * Peripheral T4→T3 conversion (deiodinase activity) — the module's distinctive mechanism.

 * conversion is fast relative to T4's week-long turnover. Illness/starvation suppresses
 * conversion efficiency directly, which is exactly the sick-euthyroid mechanism: T3 falls
 * while T4 (and TSH) can remain near-normal, since the gland/axis itself isn't diseased.
