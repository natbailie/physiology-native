      'Falling thyroid hormone releases the brake on the pituitary, so TSH climbs — high TSH with low T4 is primary hypothyroidism. TSH is the sensitive test here because the pituitary response to thyroid hormone is steep: a small drift in T4 produces a large, easily measured move in TSH. That is why TSH is the screening test even though it is not the hormone doing the work, and why an abnormal TSH with borderline-normal T4 is a real finding rather than a contradiction.',

So T3 falls while T4 and TSH stay near normal, because nothing is wrong with the gland or the axis.

That is precisely why TSH — not T4 — is used to titrate the dose: it is the readout of whether the tissue that matters is adequately supplied. Note how slowly it moves. T4 turns over across about a week, so nothing meaningful can be judged for several weeks, which is why thyroid function is rechecked at around six weeks rather than at one.',
