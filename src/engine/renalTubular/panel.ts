/**
 * The AKI workup: what the urine says when the creatinine will not. A rising creatinine is
 * shared by every cause of renal failure; the fractional excretion of sodium, the urine
 * sodium and the concentrating ability are what split a starving-but-intact nephron from a
 * dead one — and the two are treated in opposite directions.
 *
 * A leaf file with type-only imports, and that matters: `questions.ts` pulls values out of
 * the engine, so a case file importing this panel from THERE would drag the whole renal
 * engine into the ward-round index that loads on the home page. Both consumers read it here
 * instead, which also means the rows a learner is examined on are the rows the bedside shows
 * them — one definition, not two that agree until somebody edits one.
