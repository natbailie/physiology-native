Desmopressin acts on the same V2 receptor as endogenous ADH, so supplying it from outside completes the pathway.

      'Almost nothing happens, and that is the answer. Desmopressin acts through the same receptor the duct is already failing to use, so adding more agonist to an unresponsive tubule changes little. Run this question and the previous one back to back: identical presentations, identical test, opposite results. That single divergence is the whole diagnostic value of the desmopressin step, and it is why lithium- or hypercalcaemia-induced nephrogenic DI is treated by removing the cause rather than by giving hormone.',

      'The gradient washes out. The thick ascending limb builds it by pumping NaCl into the interstitium via NKCC2, which is precisely the transporter a loop diuretic blocks — so the kidney loses the tool it uses to concentrate urine. Note the ceiling this imposes: however much ADH is present, urine can never become more concentrated than the medulla, so concentrating ability is blunted even in a patient with plenty of hormone. A thiazide acts further downstream and leaves the gradient intact, which is one reason it is the milder diuretic.',

      'The urine concentrates, which is the visible output of the whole countercurrent apparatus working. ADH inserts aquaporins into the collecting duct and water leaves down the gradient the loop of Henle built — so the response needs all three: the hormone, a duct that can answer it, and a gradient to answer it into. That is exactly why a water deprivation test followed by desmopressin localises the lesion: no response to either identifies the duct, response only to desmopressin identifies the pituitary.',

      'Flow rises, but far less than a loop diuretic would produce at an equivalent dose, and the reason is anatomical. The thick ascending limb reabsorbs a quarter of the filtered sodium; the distal tubule the thiazide blocks handles only about five per cent. So the ceiling is set by how much sodium reaches the segment being blocked. That is why a loop diuretic is the drug for fluid overload and a thiazide is the drug for blood pressure, and why the two given together are far more than additive.',

    explanation:
      'The GFR falls, because the macula densa reads high distal sodium chloride as evidence that the glomerulus above it is filtering too fast and constricts the afferent arteriole in response. It is a single-nephron autoregulatory loop, and it normally protects against losing enormous volumes when filtration transiently rises. Here it is being fooled: the sodium is high because reabsorption was blocked, not because filtration rose — which is part of why the diuretic response to a loop agent plateaus.',

Every other acidotic kidney pushes urine pH toward 4.5; a distal RTA cannot, because the alpha-intercalated cell\'s pump is what creates the hydrogen ion gradient in the first place. The stones follow mechanically: alkaline urine precipitates calcium phosphate, and chronic citrate loss leaves nothing to hold the calcium in solution.

Aldosterone does three jobs through one distal mechanism: it secretes potassium, drives ammoniagenesis so acid can be buffered and excreted, and reclaims sodium. Its failure therefore produces hyperkalaemia, a positive urine anion gap, and a mild acidosis from a single cause. Note the urine still acidifies below 5.5 — the pump is fine; only the hormone is missing — which separates this from distal RTA on the plainest of tests.',

What cannot be reclaimed is lost, taking water with it — an osmotic-style diuresis of alkaline fluid, which is why the drug produces both a metabolic acidosis and an alkaline urine, a combination no other common agent causes. The acidosis is exactly why it helps at altitude: it mimics acclimatisation by ventilatory drive, compensating for the bicarbonate the kidney has been made to waste.',

Mannitol stays in the tubular lumen purely by being un-reclaimable, and the water that would have followed solute out of the nephron instead follows the mannitol out — osmotic diuresis is hydraulics, not pharmacology. This is also why any uncontrolled solute does the same thing: glucose above threshold in diabetes produces precisely this pattern, which is the polyuria that first brings those patients to medical attention.',

This number is how a rising creatinine is split into its two great families: prerenal kidneys are intact and starving, so they reclaim sodium ferociously under aldosterone and the FENa sits below 1%; post-renal-of-the-tubule kidneys shed it.
