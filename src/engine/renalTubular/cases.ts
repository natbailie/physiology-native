/**
 * Two beds, one creatinine between them.
 *
 * They were chosen to be the pair that looks identical in the blood and opposite in the
 * urine — which is the whole reason the AKI panel exists, and the reason the module's own
 * preset comments read like case notes already. Nothing here is new physiology; what is new
 * is that the numbers belong to somebody, which is the difference between reading a panel
 * and deciding what to do next.
 *
 * Observations are absent on purpose. `chart` points at `AKI_PANEL`, so the five rows are read
 * off the settled engine at the bedside and checked against it in `cases.test.ts`.

He has passed 80 mL of dark urine in the last six hours, and the morning creatinine is 2.4 where admission said 1.0. The surgical team are asking whether this kidney failure needs a nephrologist or simply more volume, and the urine sample for the panel below was sent before anyone gave anything further.',

The creatinine looks alarming but it lags by hours and reflects filtration alone; it cannot tell a starving kidney from a dead one, which is why the urine was sent. Note what diuretics would do here: strip the very compensation that is keeping him out of trouble. Contrast Vera in the next bed, whose identical creatinine comes with the opposite urine.',

Her pressure is acceptable now and she is making some urine, but the creatinine has climbed from 1.1 to 2.3 and keeps going.

Fluids resuscitate perfusion, not epithelium — no amount of volume brings dead tubular cells back, and overfilling an oliguric patient drowns the lungs while the kidney takes days to regrow what was lost. Stop the nephrotoxin, support the perfusion, watch the potassium, and wait. When the question is perfusion versus injury, the urine answers and the blood does not.',
