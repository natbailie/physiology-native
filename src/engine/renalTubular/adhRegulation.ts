 * it. That steepness is what holds plasma osmolality within a few percent despite wildly
 * varying water intake.
 *
 * Scaled by secretory capacity: in CENTRAL diabetes insipidus the osmoreceptors sense
 * correctly but the posterior pituitary cannot release ADH, so this target stays near zero
 * no matter how concentrated the plasma becomes.
