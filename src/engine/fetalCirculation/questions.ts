    explanation:
      'The right hand is in the nineties and the foot is far below it — differential cyanosis, and it localises the problem precisely. The shunt enters the aorta below the vessels supplying the head and right arm, so only the lower body receives it. Pulmonary resistance has failed to fall after birth, the fetal gradient has survived the delivery, and the duct is still shunting right to left. Note the duct has stayed open, because it responds to the oxygen tension of the blood flowing through it and that blood is desaturated.',

    explanation:
      'The duct is still open, but the saturations are equal — so it cannot be shunting right to left. Pulmonary resistance has fallen normally, and the duct now sits between a high-pressure aorta and a low-pressure pulmonary artery, carrying flow left to right and flooding the lungs. Nothing about the duct changed after birth; the pressures either side of it did. That is why the same anatomical lesion presents as cyanosis in one baby and as heart failure in another.',

    panel: PANEL,
    settleSeconds: SETTLE,
    explanation:
      'Pulmonary resistance is enormous, the duct is wide open shunting right to left, and both saturations are low — this is the circulation working exactly as designed, because the lung is not the oxygenating organ yet. The saturations that would signal catastrophe after birth are simply normal before it.

Prostaglandin was the only thing holding it open against an oxygen tension high enough to constrict it — in utero the placenta supplied that prostaglandin, which is why the duct was patent before birth and starts closing after. The same logic is why oxygen is given cautiously in these babies: the instinct to correct a low saturation would shut the one channel keeping them perfused.',

Removing it is half of the transition, and the half usually forgotten — the other half is pulmonary resistance falling as the lung aerates. The two move in opposite directions and cross over, and every fetal shunt was running on the old gradient. Understanding the crossover is understanding why the shunts reverse and then close.',
