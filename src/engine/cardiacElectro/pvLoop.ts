 * the clock. That is what makes the PV loop respond correctly to afterload: raise aortic
 * pressure and the aortic valve simply opens later, shortening ejection on its own.
 *
 * - Filling: mitral valve open (LV pressure below atrial filling pressure)
 * - Isovolumic contraction: both valves shut, pressure rising at constant volume
 * - Ejection: aortic valve open (LV pressure has exceeded afterload)
 * - Isovolumic relaxation: both valves shut again, pressure falling at constant volume
