    explanation:
      'Bone conduction beats air conduction — a negative Rinne — which means the middle ear is blocking sound the cochlea would happily receive. The audiogram shows a large air-bone gap with bone thresholds normal and Weber lateralising toward the blocked ear. Nothing is wrong with the cochlea itself: no recruitment, and discrimination stays intact once sound gets through. Stapes fixation from otosclerosis is the classic cause in a young adult.',

    explanation:
      'Deaf to whispers but intolerant of shouts is recruitment — loudness growing abnormally fast because the cochlear amplifier that used to compress is gone. The notch centred on 4 kHz is where the external canal concentrates noise energy, and there is no air-bone gap: the loss is in the cochlea. Presbycusis also gives sensorineural loss but slopes smoothly rather than notching, and Ménière disease attacks the opposite end of the frequency map.',

      'Low-frequency sensorineural loss is the audiometric signature of Ménière disease — endolymphatic hydrops distending the apical part of the membranous labyrinth.

Combined with episodic vertigo and fluctuating low-tone hearing, the pattern is characteristic.',
