/**
 * The audiogram plus the forks: pure-tone average, air-bone gap, discrimination, recruitment
 * and Weber. Between them these place the loss — gap or no gap, cochlea working or not — and
 * no one of them does it alone. A gap with intact discrimination is a mechanical problem with
 * a mechanical fix; no gap with recruitment is a cochlear one, managed and never cured.
 *
 * A leaf file with type-only imports, and that matters: `questions.ts` pulls values out of
 * the engine, so a case file importing this panel from THERE would drag the whole hearing
 * engine into the ward-round index that loads on the home page. Both consumers read it here
 * instead, which also means the rows a learner is examined on are the rows the bedside shows
 * them — one definition, not two that agree until somebody edits one.
