      paragraphs: [
        'Sound reaches the cochlea by two routes. Air conduction rides the eardrum and ossicles; bone conduction bypasses all of that and shakes the skull straight into the cochlea. This is why a single tuning fork can localise a fault before any audiogram exists. If the middle ear is blocked — fluid, otosclerosis, a dislocated chain — bone conduction survives untouched while air conduction fails, producing an air-bone gap. Load the otosclerosis preset and read it off: a forty-decibel gap, bone thresholds normal, Weber lateralising toward the affected ear because the blocked cochlea hears the fork without air-borne competition. Lateralisation toward the deaf ear is the counterintuitive signature of conductive loss.',

      paragraphs: [
        'The cochlea then does two jobs at once with one piece of machinery. The outer hair cells are an active amplifier: they add energy near threshold so the healthy ear hears whispers, and they compress gracefully as sound grows, buying a hundred-decibel dynamic range inside neurons that saturate over perhaps twenty. Damage them and both behaviours fail together — thresholds rise and the compression disappears. That double failure is recruitment: the recruited ear is deaf to quiet sounds yet intolerant of loud ones, because its loudness now grows almost linearly from a raised floor. A conductive ear is simply quieter throughout; a cochlear ear has lost its volume control.',

      heading: 'Inner hair cells are transducers, and no amplifier replaces them',
      paragraphs: [
        'Inner hair cells are different in kind: they are the transducers, the cells whose firing the auditory nerve reads. Destroy them and no amount of amplification helps, because there is nothing left to drive cleanly — which is why discrimination falls even when audibility is restored by a hearing aid. Watch speech discrimination fall on the severe cochlear loss preset while the audiogram alone might suggest amplification should work. The distinction matters clinically: outer hair cell loss gives recruitment with preserved discrimination; inner hair cell loss adds distortion on top.',

        'The frequency map along the basilar membrane is ordered — apex for lows, base for highs — so patterns of loss name their causes. Presbycusis slopes downward through the decades, sparing the lows first. Noise damage notches sharply at 4 kHz, the resonance of the external canal concentrating energy there, often with a normal pure-tone average hiding it. Ménière disease floods the apex and takes the low frequencies instead. Read the audiogram shape before the numbers: where the loss sits is half the diagnosis.',

        'Two dynamic behaviours complete the picture. The stapedius reflex contracts above about 85 dB HL, stiffening the ossicular chain and buying a few decibels — the ear\'s own limiter, absent when the middle ear cannot move. And after a loud exposure the ear shows temporary threshold shift: a reversible rise in thresholds that recovers over hours, the physiology behind "everything sounds muffled" after a concert. It is also a warning, because repeated shifts accumulate into the permanent notch. Run the noise exposure action and watch thresholds climb and then decay — recovery, but never free.',
