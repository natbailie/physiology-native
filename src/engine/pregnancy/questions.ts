      'Plasma volume expands faster than red cell mass — up to forty-five per cent versus twenty-five — so the concentration of haemoglobin falls even as total red cells increase by a quarter. The trough near 30 weeks is physiological, and normal indices here confirm dilution rather than deficiency. Treating it reflexively risks the opposite error: missing true anaemia hiding behind a number that looks acceptable only against non-pregnant ranges.',

A low CO2 with the bicarbonate falling alongside it is compensation; a low CO2 with normal bicarbonate would be the pathological pattern.

This division of labour is why some drugs suppress ejection while production continues, and why stress inhibits let-down long before it touches supply.',
