      'The dissociation IS the localisation. Dorsal columns ascend ipsilaterally to the medulla, so left-sided touch and joint-position loss means the lesion is on the left; spinothalamic fibres crossed within a segment of entry, so right-sided pinprick loss is also the left hemi-cord. One side injured, two modalities lost on opposite sides — Brown-Séquard. A complete transection would lose everything bilaterally; anterior cord syndrome would spare the touch.',
