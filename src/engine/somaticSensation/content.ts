        'Pain is not a line from the injury to the brain; it is an output of the dorsal horn that can be opened and closed before it ever ascends. The gate: nociceptive C-fibre traffic opens transmission cells to projection, while large Aβ touch fibres, rubbing counterstimulus, descending modulation from the midbrain, and opioid action all close it. This is why rubbing a fresh bump genuinely helps, why distraction works, and why opioids act at both cord and brainstem. Load the burn preset, then rub the area — watch the gate readout close and the pain score fall with nothing else changed about the injury at all.',

        'Latency tells you which fibres are carrying what. Over a limb length, Aδ fibres deliver sharp first pain in under a tenth of a second; unmyelinated C fibres deliver the slow burning second pain more than a second later. The same ordering governs drug blocks: local anaesthetics silence small nociceptive fibres long before thick Aβ touch fibres, which is why a dental patient feels pressure but not the drill. Run the block preset — pain traffic gone, touch traffic largely intact. That differential is also why spinal anaesthesia takes away pain and temperature before it takes away proprioception.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Then sensitisation inverts the system entirely. Inflammatory mediators lower thresholds in the periphery while sustained C-input recruits NMDA-dependent amplification centrally (wind-up). Once sensitised, Aβ traffic itself begins to drive pain pathways — light touch hurts. That is allodynia, and it separates neuropathic states from simple nociception: the stimulus is innocent, the machinery is not. On the neuropathic preset, raise the touch slider alone and watch the pain score climb with the nociceptors essentially silent.',

        'The ascending anatomy then explains every dissociated sensory loss examiners ask for. Dorsal columns carry touch and proprioception UP the same side, crossing in the medulla; spinothalamic fibres cross within a segment or two of entering and ascend on the opposite side. A hemisection therefore takes touch below on its own side but pain on the other — Brown-Séquard, the classic dissociation. Load it: left body loses left touch, right body loses right pain, from one knife.',

        'The other tract patterns follow the same logic. Anterior-quadrant damage takes both spinothalamics — lost pain and temperature below with dorsal columns spared, the anterior cord syndrome of an infarct or flexion injury, with corticospinal tracts travelling alongside. A syrinx expanding from the central canal interrupts pain fibres exactly where they cross in front of it, producing a cape-like segmental loss of pain and temperature with everything below intact and columns untouched — the reason these patients burn their hands without noticing. Complete transection spares nothing. Learn the crossings and every pattern derives itself; memorise the list instead and they blur together.',
