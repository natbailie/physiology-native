/**
 * Two beds, one raised gastrin between them.
 *
 * They were chosen to be the pair that shares a laboratory number and means opposite things
 * by it: autonomous drive with crashed pH against drug-induced drive with high pH. Nothing
 * here is new physiology; what is new is that the numbers belong to somebody, which is the
 * difference between reading a panel and deciding what to do next.
 *
 * Observations are absent on purpose. `chart` points at `GI_PANEL`, so the five rows are
 * read off the settled engine at the bedside and checked against it in `cases.test.ts`.

      'Autonomous gastrin bypasses the somatostatin brake completely, so acid output runs far above anything meal-driven physiology reaches and the pH crashes: severe, multiple, distally-sited ulcers, and diarrhoea because the acid flood overwhelms duodenal bicarbonate and inactivates pancreatic enzymes downstream. No feedback loop can switch a tumour off, which is why suppression alone keeps failing him — he needs the source found, with high-dose blockade holding the line meanwhile. Contrast Paula, whose identical raised gastrin sits beside a high pH and means the drug is working.',

The pH row is what separates her from Victor in the next bed: high here, crashed there, for the same raised gastrin. That is also why the drug must be stopped before gastrin is ever measured to investigate a suspected gastrinoma — measure through the blockade and every treated patient looks like a tumour. Cancel the referral, not the prescription.',
