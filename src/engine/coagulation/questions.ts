    panel: SCREEN,
    explanation:
      'A prolonged APTT with a normal PT localises the defect to the intrinsic limb, and normal platelets with a normal bleeding time rule out the platelet arm entirely. That is haemophilia. Note the model cannot tell A from B here, and neither can this panel — the intrinsic tenase is a multiplicative pairing of VIIIa and IXa, so losing either produces the identical result and only a factor assay separates them. Deep joint and muscle bleeding, rather than mucosal oozing, is the clinical signature.',

    id: 'prolonged-bleeding-time',
    stem: 'A young woman reports heavy periods, frequent nosebleeds and prolonged bleeding after a dental extraction. Her platelet count is normal.',
    answer: 'vonWillebrand',
    options: ['vonWillebrand', 'thrombocytopenia', 'hemophiliaA', 'normal'],
    panel: SCREEN,
    explanation:
      'A prolonged bleeding time with a NORMAL platelet count points at platelet function rather than platelet number, and von Willebrand factor is what platelets need to stick to damaged vessel wall. The APTT is prolonged too, which surprises people until you remember vWF is the carrier for factor VIII — lose it and factor VIII falls with it. Mucosal bleeding is the clinical signature, in contrast to the deep joint bleeds of haemophilia.',

    answer: 'dic',
    options: ['dic', 'liverDisease', 'warfarin', 'thrombocytopenia'],
    panel: FULL,
    explanation:
      'Liver disease and DIC both prolong PT and APTT, because a failing liver makes fewer of the same factors that DIC consumes. The D-dimer is what separates them: DIC is active clotting and active lysis throughout the circulation, so fibrin degradation products are high, while a liver that is merely underproducing has nothing extra to break down. The falling fibrinogen and platelets point the same way — they are being consumed, not just under-made.',

    answer: 'warfarin',
    options: ['warfarin', 'hemophiliaA', 'thrombocytopenia', 'heparin'],
    panel: SCREEN,
    explanation:
      'A prolonged PT with a relatively preserved APTT points to the extrinsic limb, and factor VII — the shortest-lived of the vitamin K dependent factors — is the first to fall when that pathway is blocked. This is why the INR tracks warfarin. Heparin would hit the APTT hardest instead, by accelerating antithrombin against thrombin and factor Xa, which is the reason the two drugs are monitored with different tests.',
