    explanation:
      'Ketones rise from trace to several mmol/L, because sixty hours of fasting has spent the glycogen that was damping gluconeogenesis and the liver is now making fat-derived ketones as the brain\'s alternative fuel. The glucose that stays near-normal is the point: the body defends its blood sugar while switching the rest of the economy to fat, and the rising ketones are the visible end of that handover. This is the physiology fasting clinics and the keto fad are talking about, and the reason a starved patient is not a hypoglycaemic patient until gluconeogenesis itself fails.',

    explanation:
      'Ketones fall essentially to nothing, and quickly: the moment carbohydrate arrives, insulin rises, glucagon falls, and ketogenesis is switched off because the brain no longer needs a fat-derived substitute. What is often called "the quickest metabolic reversal in medicine" is real — refeeding switches the fuel economy from catabolic to anabolic within hours, which is also why very rapid refeeding after prolonged starvation can precipitate dangerous shifts in potassium and phosphate. The ketone curve is the safest way to watch the refeeding process land.',

    explanation:
      'The carbohydrate share collapses from roughly half of the mix to a small gluconeogenic remnant, because once glycogen is spent there is no stored carbohydrate left to burn. The body does not stop spending energy — it simply switches suppliers, and fat becomes the dominant fuel. That is the single most useful thing a learner can take from this module: fasting is not an energy deficit so much as a fuel-switch, and the "metabolic switch" you may have heard about is exactly the hours-to-fat tipping point this slider walks across.',

    explanation:
      'Glucose rises well above the normal range, because resistance blunts the one mechanism that clears it — insulin-mediated uptake into muscle and liver. The same fasting clock now produces a much higher glucose, which is why skipping meals does not "fix" diabetes: the glucose is not high because of what was eaten but because of what insulin can no longer do. The model also shows the second signature: the resistant liver keeps enough insulin tone to suppress ketosis, so the same starvation that produces brisk ketones in a healthy person produces hyperglycaemia without them here.',

      'The energy bill roughly doubles, because the stress response multiplies the resting metabolic rate on top of what activity already adds. This is why critical illness causes rapid wasting despite aggressive feeding: the calorie requirement is not ordinary maintenance plus a little — it is a whole extra patient\'s worth of turnover. It also reframes the clinical complaint "he\'s starving despite what we feed him": in catabolic stress the demand is genuinely structural, and that is exactly the difference the fasting slider cannot capture on its own.',

    explanation:
      'The protein share roughly doubles, because gluconeogenesis is feeding a much larger glucose demand and is harvesting amino acids to do it — cortisol and glucagon are both pushing protein breakdown faster than the gut can replace it. The teaching point is that muscle is being consumed as a fuel in a catabolic state even when feeding is adequate. Refeeding or "giving more protein" has real limits because the demand scales with the stress, which is why nutrition support is protocol-driven and why the catabolic slider is the one that makes the muscle burn visible.',

      'Energy expenditure rises with activity because the multiply-by-MET term is the exercise half of the energy equation: four METs is four times the resting bill. The glucose that stays in range is the reason the model shows the whole system working together — activity raises demand while insulin can still move carbohydrate in, so the fuel mix shifts but the fasting physiology is unchanged. It is the contrast to the trauma case, where the same kind of elevated demand comes with a hormone profile that prevents the fuel switch from being clean.',

      'It barely moves, because by twenty-four hours glycogen is gone and gluconeogenesis has already taken over — and once the floor is gluconeogenic, the next two days change the supplier\'s speed, not the target. This is the defensive physiology the whole axis is built around: a starved adult holds glucose near 4 mmol/L for a very long time before the mechanisms themselves start to fail.

A learner who reads only the glucose leaps to "uncontrolled sugar"; the ketone row is what rules out the starvation diagnosis next door. This is the concrete payoff of keeping the resistance and fasting dials separate rather than collapsing them into one "how sick" slider.',
