    metric: performance,
    explanation:
      'Performance falls sharply because a harder task relocates the arousal optimum down the axis: the optimum for demand 85 sits at an arousal of around 14, and the student\'s calm 45% is now on the far shoulder of a curve that moved away from them. The same arousal that was near-peak for an easy problem is now wrong for a hard one — the literal meaning of "the task decides the optimum". The demand also overshoots the reserve, so the index roughly halves while the effort bar climbs. A learner doing fine can look suddenly worse when the work hardens precisely because the peak moved.',

    explanation:
      'Performance collapses even though the task did not get harder, because the inverted-U cuts both sides of the peak. For an easy problem the optimum sits around forty percent arousal, and ninety-two percent is so far over it that the curve has reached the floor — the cascade of a choke. The arousal-optimality tile drops toward zero, and the effort it buys falls too, because effort far from the optimum is moot and the reserve never opens. Easy task, wrong arousal, catastrophic grade: the module\'s clearest proof that arousal is a dial to set, not a level to maximise.',

    explanation:
      'Deployed effort collapses even at the same task, because fatigue withdraws from the executive reserve itself rather than making the work feel heavier: every unit of fatigue cuts the reserve that effort can draw on, and at fatigue around 85 the reserve door is effectively shut, leaving barely enough effort to start, let alone persist. This is the physiology behind "I wanted to work and could not" — motivation stayed intact while the reserve stopped paying out. The fatigue slider and the reserve meter are the same story read twice: one sets the price, the other the availability.',

    explanation:
      'Occupancy rises without a single extra chunk of content, because distraction consumes capacity: the 7±2 rack is a fixed size, and the noise occupies part of it while the lesson still demands its own share. The rack fills towards the cliff even though the learner tried to hold nothing more, which is the mechanism that lets one notification derail reasoning that would otherwise fit. The number worth watching is not the distraction slider but the occupancy it buys — mental noise is expensive.',

      'Occupancy climbs toward the ceiling because the 7±2 rack has no elasticity: seven chunks is the maximum headroom was built for, and even modest background friction pushes the fill past the margin where there is still slack to think. The metric that matters is occupancy rather than load, because it packages load AND the friction stealing from it into one reading — "too much to hold" and "too noisy to hold it" resolve to the same number.',

At an arousal far from the task optimum the reserve is already the main thing keeping effort alive, so cutting it from eighteen to five percent collapses what the learner can mount.

      'The performance index crashes to its floor, and the reason is the multiplication rather than either knob alone. Hardening the task dragged the optimum down to roughly fourteen percent arousal while raising arousal to ninety-two dragged the learner to the opposite shoulder — together they land an enormous distance from the peak, which is the very definition of choking under pressure. Difficulty and arousal are not independent dials to tune: the task moves the target and the arousal moves the arrow, and when both go the wrong way the outcome is worse than the sum of their individual costs.',

      'The panic attack is the one whose demand overshoot crosses the cliff.

The exam stress is also over-aroused but its overshoot stays below the cliff (near 23% rather than 34%), so it mostly chokes rather than plainly overwhelms; the sleep-deprived and relaxed scenarios never leave the reserve line at all.
