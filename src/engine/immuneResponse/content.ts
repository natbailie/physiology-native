        'A primary response is slow for a structural reason. Innate immunity — neutrophils, macrophages, complement — is active within hours, but it is fixed and non-specific, and it can only slow an organism down, not clear it. Meanwhile dendritic cells must sample antigen, migrate to a lymph node, and find the one naive lymphocyte in millions that happens to recognise it. That search takes days, and the pathogen is replicating exponentially throughout. Almost everything that makes a first infection an illness happens during that delay.',

        'Helper T cells are the hub the whole adaptive system turns on. They license cytotoxic T cells to kill infected cells, and they supply the second signal B cells need to switch class from IgM to the far more potent IgG. Because one cell type gates both arms, losing it takes out cellular and humoral immunity simultaneously — which is exactly why CD4 count predicts opportunistic infection in HIV so well. Compare the HIV preset with the B-cell deficiency preset and watch the difference: the B-cell defect leaves cytotoxic killing perfectly intact, whereas CD4 depletion flattens both.',

        'Which arm actually matters depends on where the organism hides. Antibody neutralises pathogens in the extracellular space but cannot reach inside a host cell, so an intracellular organism has to be dealt with by cytotoxic T cells killing the infected cell itself. Switch the pathogen type and you change which deficiency is dangerous, not merely how sick the host gets.',

        'The antibody isotypes are a clock as much as a mechanism. IgM is produced first because it needs no class switching; IgG requires the switch, and the switch requires helper T cell support, so it necessarily lags. That ordering is why serology can date an infection rather than merely detect it — IgM suggests a recent or current encounter, IgG a past one or an established response. And it is why a memory response looks qualitatively different on the lab report: it produces IgG almost immediately, skipping the IgM phase a naive host has to go through.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Vaccination works by exploiting a gap in what the immune system can distinguish. The adaptive arm responds to antigen, not to damage, so an antigen delivered without a replicating organism drives the same presentation, the same helper T licensing, the same class switching and the same memory formation. The host pays the cost of a primary response at a moment of its choosing, when nothing is dividing exponentially in the background. Set the vaccine antigen here and then infect, and compare the curves against infecting a naive host — the difference is entirely in the timing.',

        'Memory is the payoff, and here it emerges from the model rather than being scripted. Surviving an infection leaves a persistent population of memory cells, which does two things: it removes the search delay, and it raises the number of antigen-specific precursors so the response is bigger as well as faster. Clear an infection, then infect the same host again — the organism barely grows before it is met, clearance takes a fraction as long, and there is essentially no fever. Vaccination reaches the identical end state by a shorter road: antigen without a replicating organism, so memory forms and the host is never ill at all.',
