/**
 * The urodynamic picture: volume, pressure, and the two tones plus the afferent signal that
 * decide what happens next. Between them these name the failure; no one of them does it
 * alone — a high pressure with a quiet detrusor is a different patient from a high pressure
 * with an overactive one, and opposite treatments follow.
 *
 * A leaf file with type-only imports, and that matters: `questions.ts` pulls values out of
 * the engine, so a case file importing this panel from THERE would drag the whole
 * micturition engine into the ward-round index that loads on the home page. Both consumers
 * read it here instead, which also means the rows a learner is examined on are the rows the
 * bedside shows them — one definition, not two that agree until somebody edits one.
