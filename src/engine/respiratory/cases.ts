      'Nineteen, newly unwell, and breathing in a way the triage nurse described as "sighing". She has been thirsty for three days and vomiting since last night. Her respiratory rate is 32 and her chest is clear. The house officer has noted the fast breathing and is asking whether she needs something for anxiety.',

      'The low bicarbonate and the wide anion gap are the disease: unmeasured ketoacids are consuming buffer. The low PaCO2 is not a second problem, it is the answer to the first — Kussmaul breathing blowing off CO2 to hold the pH up, and it is the only thing keeping her out of a far worse number. Sedating that respiratory drive would remove her compensation and drop the pH straight down. Check Winter’s formula against the PaCO2 here: the compensation is appropriate, which is itself the finding.',

A respiratory acidosis this well compensated is by definition chronic, so the number is his normal rather than his crisis. Treating the figure instead of the patient is how a comfortable man ends up ventilated. What would worry you is the same PaCO2 with a pH of 7.20 and a bicarbonate that has not moved — that gas is hours old, not years.',

Salicylate stimulates the respiratory centre directly — that is the primary respiratory alkalosis and the low PaCO2 — while simultaneously uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and generating organic acid, which is the raised anion gap. Neither is compensation for the other; both are the poison. The give-away is arithmetic rather than intuition: compute the expected compensation for each and it overshoots, because a second process is running alongside.',
