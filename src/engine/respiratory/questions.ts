That is Kussmaul respiration, and note what produced it: nothing set the breathing rate. The deep sighing pattern is the reflex answering the pH, which is why respiratory compensation appears within minutes while renal compensation takes days.

    explanation:
      'Below roughly 60 mmHg the peripheral chemoreceptors recruit strongly, and the hypoxic ventilatory response drives minute ventilation up. Increased alveolar ventilation blows off CO2, so PaCO2 falls and a respiratory alkalosis appears — before any renal compensation has had time to answer it. The alkalosis is the price of defending oxygenation, and it is what acetazolamide is given to pre-empt.',

    explanation:
      'This patient has been hypercapnic so long that the CO2 component of their ventilatory drive is maximal and stuck there — it has nothing left to give. What was still holding their ventilation up was the hypoxaemia, sensed by the peripheral chemoreceptors below about 60 mmHg. Flood them with oxygen and that component is withdrawn, ventilation falls, and PaCO2 climbs. Watch SaO2 at the same time: it improves, and genuinely so. That is the whole difficulty — oxygen is doing exactly what it was given to do while making the ventilation worse, which is why it is titrated to a target saturation (88-92% in a known retainer) rather than turned up until the number looks reassuring. Note this simulation shows only the loss of hypoxic drive; in a real patient, released hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction worsening V/Q matching contributes at least as much.',

The important word is acute: renal compensation takes days, so there is nothing yet to blunt it.

Here there is no compensation in either direction, and the treatment is circulation and ventilation, not bicarbonate.',
