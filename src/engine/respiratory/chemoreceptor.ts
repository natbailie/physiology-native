/**
 * Target chemoreceptor drive (-1..1) — the sum of the two components above.

 * The components are clamped SEPARATELY before being summed, and that is the whole point:
 * clamping only the sum meant any patient hypoventilating enough to be hypoxaemic already
 * had drive pinned at 1 from CO2/pH alone, so removing the hypoxaemia (supplemental O2)
 * changed ventilation not at all. Reserving the top of the range for the hypoxic component
 * makes the withdrawal of hypoxic drive a real loss of ventilation, which is what produces
 * oxygen-induced hypercapnia in a chronic CO2 retainer.
 *
 * The engine relaxes the actual (smoothed) drive toward this target on
 * CHEMORECEPTOR.TAU_SECONDS — the fastest actuator in this module, mirroring how
 * baroreflexDrive is the fastest in the cardiorenal module.
