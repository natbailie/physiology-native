 * The arterial blood gas, as it is actually reported.
 *
 * Four rows, and no one of them names the disorder alone: pH says how bad it is, PaCO2 and
 * bicarbonate say which half is responsible, and the anion gap separates two acidoses that are
 * otherwise identical. Reading the combination is the skill; these questions show nothing else.
 *
 * A leaf with type-only imports, so `cases.ts` can share it without dragging the engine onto
 * the home page — see `panel.ts` in shockStates for the full reasoning.
