      paragraphs: [
        'Blood pH is set by the ratio of bicarbonate to dissolved CO2 — the Henderson-Hasselbalch relation, pH = 6.1 + log10(HCO3 / 0.03 x PaCO2). The two terms are controlled by different organs on completely different timescales: the lung sets PaCO2 breath by breath, the kidney sets bicarbonate over days. That division of labour is the reason acid-base disorders are classified as respiratory or metabolic in the first place, and the reason each one has a characteristic compensating partner.',
        'It is the RATIO that sets the pH, not either number alone, and that single fact explains most acid-base interpretation. A patient can have a grossly abnormal bicarbonate and a grossly abnormal PaCO2 and a pH close to normal, because the two moved together. Compensation works by restoring the ratio while leaving both components deranged — which is why the pH tells you how well-compensated someone is and the individual values tell you what they are compensating FOR. Reading only the pH hides the disorder; reading only the components hides the severity.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Chemoreceptors sense rising CO2, falling pH, or — only once quite low — falling oxygen, and adjust ventilation within seconds to minutes. This is why Kussmaul breathing appears in DKA: the lungs are compensating for a metabolic acid load, not the primary problem.',
        'The two sensors can also be played off against each other. In someone chronically hypercapnic, the CO2 arm of the drive is already maximal, so what still holds their ventilation up is the hypoxaemia. Give them enough oxygen to abolish it and ventilation falls and PaCO2 rises — saturation improves and CO2 worsens at the same time. That trade-off is why oxygen is titrated to a target saturation rather than maximised.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Sustained CO2 or pH derangement also triggers slow renal compensation (days): the kidneys generate or excrete bicarbonate to partially normalize pH. This is why chronic COPD can show a near-normal pH despite a persistently high PaCO2, while an acute panic attack’s respiratory alkalosis remains uncompensated.',
        'Three defences run at completely different speeds, and knowing which one is currently doing the work is most of the clinical reasoning. Chemical buffering is essentially instantaneous. The chemoreceptors adjust ventilation over seconds to minutes. Renal compensation takes days, because it works by generating or excreting bicarbonate rather than by changing anything already in the blood. That ordering is why an acute and a chronic disturbance with identical numbers mean entirely different things, and why the renal arm — which the model lets you switch off — is what separates a compensated chronic picture from an acute crisis.',

      heading: 'Compensation never overshoots, and that is what exposes a second disorder',
      paragraphs: [
        'Compensation has limits, and the limits are what make interpretation possible. A patient compensating a chronic respiratory acidosis is entitled to a raised bicarbonate — roughly one extra milliequivalent per 10 mmHg of PaCO2 acutely, rising toward three and a half per 10 mmHg once the kidney has had days to work. A bicarbonate inside that band needs no further explanation. One ABOVE it cannot be compensation at all, because compensation never overshoots, so a second disorder must be present. That is the whole logic of spotting a mixed picture: not that the numbers look odd, but that one of them is further from normal than any response to the other could put it.',
        'Notice what this means for the acute-versus-chronic question. A single blood gas cannot tell you how long a PaCO2 has been abnormal, and the bicarbonate a patient deserves depends entirely on that — a PaCO2 of 70 justifies a bicarbonate of 27 on the first day and 34 after a fortnight. So the honest expectation is a band spanning both, and only a value outside the whole band proves anything. Collapsing it to a single expected number is the commonest way an interpretation invents a disorder that is not there. It also means a patient who cannot compensate at all looks identical to one who simply has not had time to.',

      paragraphs: [
        'The Davenport diagram puts the two halves of the disturbance into two directions on one picture. Bicarbonate is plotted against pH, with curves of constant PaCO2 running across it, so a purely respiratory change slides the patient along the buffer line and across those curves, while a purely metabolic one moves them vertically off the line and stays on the same curve. A patient who has moved in both directions at once has two disorders, and it is visible at a glance well before it is calculable. Load the salicylate preset and watch where it lands: down and to the left of everything a single disorder could produce.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Two acidoses can be identical on pH and bicarbonate and still have entirely different causes, which is what the anion gap is calculated to detect. Every bicarbonate ion consumed by an acid is replaced by something. An organic acid — ketoacid, lactate, salicylate — hands over its proton and leaves its conjugate base behind, an anion nobody measures, so the gap widens one-for-one with the bicarbonate lost. Diarrhoea or a renal tubular acidosis loses bicarbonate with chloride taking its place, and chloride IS measured, so the gap never moves. Switch the acid type here and watch: the pH does not budge and the gap changes completely.',
        'The delta ratio takes that one step further and finds a third disorder. It compares how far the gap has opened against how far the bicarbonate has fallen, and in a pure organic acidosis the two move together at close to one. A ratio well below one means bicarbonate has dropped further than the gap explains, so a normal-gap acidosis is present as well. A ratio well above two means something has been holding the bicarbonate up — a metabolic alkalosis hiding underneath. This is how a vomiting ketoacidotic patient with an almost reasonable pH turns out to have three things wrong at once.',

        'Oxygen behaves quite differently from CO2, and the dissociation curve is why. Haemoglobin saturation is a sigmoid function of PaO2, not a linear one, so above roughly 60 mmHg the curve is nearly flat — large falls in PaO2 barely move the saturation — while below it the curve turns steeply downward and small further falls cost a great deal. This is why a saturation probe is reassuring across a wide range and then deteriorates abruptly, and why PaO2 and saturation are not interchangeable numbers. Note the model uses a fixed curve, so the Bohr shifts produced by pH, CO2 and temperature are outside its scope.',
