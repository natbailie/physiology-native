      'The absorbed dose quadruples and the plasma follows it: more milligrams per kilogram sitting in the same litre-per-kg volume means a proportionally higher concentration at every hour.

The panel says so plainly — absorbed dose equal but charcoal uptake, then plasma together decide the picture. The histogram-reading skill is exactly the written exam one: give the same numbers, the answer falls out.',
