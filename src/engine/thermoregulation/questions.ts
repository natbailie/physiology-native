      'The set point has been raised by pyrogen-driven prostaglandins, so a core of 39 is still below where the hypothalamus wants it — the patient experiences genuine cold and generates heat to reach it. Shivering under blankets with a high reading is the signature of DEFENDED temperature. Exertional heat stroke shows hot dry skin and a normal set point; the treatments are entirely different because the mechanisms are.',
