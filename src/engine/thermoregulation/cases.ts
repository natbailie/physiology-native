/**
 * Two beds, one high thermometer between them.
 *
 * They were chosen to be the pair the whole module exists to separate: a defended temperature
 * against an overwhelmed one. Same fever-range numbers, opposite set points, opposite
 * treatments — blankets for one would cook the other, and ice for one would be fought off by
 * the other. Nothing here is new physiology; what is new is that the numbers belong to
 * somebody, which is the difference between reading a panel and deciding what to do next.
 *
 * Observations are absent on purpose. `chart` points at `THERMO_PANEL`, so the five rows are
 * read off the settled engine at the bedside and checked against it in `cases.test.ts`.

      'The set point has been raised by pyrogen-driven prostaglandins, so a core of 39 is still below where the hypothalamus wants it: he experiences genuine cold and generates heat to reach it, which is exactly what shivering under blankets with a high reading means. The blankets stay — and an antipyretic works not by cooling him but by lowering the defended point, which is why the fever then "breaks" into sweats. Contrast Gordon, whose point never moved: blankets on him would trap heat nothing is defending, and ice is the treatment instead.',

Hot dry skin past 40 means evaporation has failed completely, which is the emergency inside the emergency — cooling must be immediate and external, because no physiology will fix a ledger this far out of balance. Paracetamol is pointless here: there is no raised point to lower. Contrast Neil, whose identical-range temperature is defended and would simply re-assert itself against the ice.',
