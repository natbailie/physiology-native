    explanation:
      'The pressure is normal and the reserve is gone — and the reserve is what matters. CSF and venous blood have been displaced to accommodate the mass, which is exactly what the fixed box permits until it does not. This patient sits at the knee of the pressure-volume curve, where the next few millilitres of anything, a small bleed or a little oedema, will do what the first sixty did not. A normal intracranial pressure is reassuring about the present and says nothing about the margin.',

    explanation:
      'Flow is following pressure passively, which means autoregulation has been lost — and that is the finding, not the high flow itself. With autoregulation intact this blood pressure would have produced an entirely normal flow. Abolish it and the same pressure becomes hyperaemia, just as a low pressure would become ischaemia. That is why blood pressure is controlled deliberately after a head injury rather than merely kept "adequate".',

    panel: PANEL,

    explanation:
      'The reserve is gone and the mass has pushed well beyond it, so the exponential part of the curve is doing the work: the pressure is high and every further millilitre is expensive.

CO2 is the most powerful cerebral vasodilator there is, so lowering it constricts the vessels, shrinks cerebral blood volume, and removes volume from a box that has none to spare. It is the fastest lever anyone has. But watch the flow readout at the same time: the constriction that bought the pressure also cut perfusion, which is why this is a bridge to definitive treatment and not a treatment itself.',

      'Perfusion pressure falls, because a vessel is compressed by whatever surrounds it and the downstream pressure is now the venous one rather than the intracranial one. Nothing inside the skull has changed. CSF absorption also fails, since it needs a gradient into the venous sinus, so pressure climbs from that direction too. This is why sitting the patient up and straightening the neck is the first and cheapest manoeuvre in a rising intracranial pressure.',
