    explanation:
      'Acral growth plus new snoring is the acromegaly story, and the numbers confirm an autonomous somatotroph adenoma: GH massively elevated with IGF-1 high. The glucose suppression result is the diagnostic clincher — a normal axis shuts GH down under a glucose load, while the adenoma ignores hypothalamic control entirely. IGF-1 is the better screening value because it integrates days of pulsatile secretion.',

    explanation:
      'Prolactin above roughly 250 in the presence of a mass means the mass is the secretor — a macroprolactinoma. Prolactin suppresses GnRH, which is why periods stop before anything else happens. Contrast the stalk-effect pattern: a non-functioning mass lifts prolactin only moderately, never into these ranges. The treatment follows the mechanism: dopamine agonists restore the brake and shrink the tumour.',

Stalk effect would need a mass; a microprolactinoma usually pushes higher; and the moderate band here matches drugs or TRH drive rather than autonomous secretion.',
