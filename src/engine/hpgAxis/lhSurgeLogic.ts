 * Integrates "sustained high estrogen exposure" for one tick.
 *
 * The switch from negative to positive feedback needs estrogen to be BOTH above a threshold
 * AND to have stayed there for a while — roughly 36-48 hours in reality. Modeling it as an
 * integrator rather than a simple threshold is what makes the surge fire once per cycle: a
 * brief estrogen spike accumulates a little exposure and then decays away harmlessly, while
 * the sustained rise of a maturing follicle eventually crosses the line.
 *
 * This is why the surge emerges from estrogen dynamics rather than being scheduled on a fixed
 * cycle day — and why anything that blunts the follicular estrogen rise (the combined oral
 * contraceptive, hypothalamic amenorrhea) prevents ovulation without having to act on the
 * ovary directly.
