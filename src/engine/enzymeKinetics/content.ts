        'Michaelis-Menten kinetics is one equation that explains an enormous amount of medicine: v = Vmax·[S] / (Km + [S]). At low substrate the velocity is almost proportional to how much substrate there is — first-order, each extra molecule gets processed. As substrate rises, the enzyme\'s active sites fill up, and velocity flattens toward Vmax — zero-order, the enzyme is working flat out and more substrate just queues. Km is the substrate concentration at which the enzyme runs at exactly half of Vmax, and it is read as a measure of how tightly the enzyme holds its substrate: low Km means high affinity. Every point on this curve is computed live from that one equation; nothing here is drawn.',

      paragraphs: [
        'The three classes of inhibition are distinguished by what happens to two numbers, which is why examiners love them. A competitive inhibitor competes for the active site, so apparent Km rises — the enzyme seems to hold its substrate less tightly — but Vmax is untouched, because flood the system with enough substrate and every inhibitor molecule is outcompeted. A pure noncompetitive inhibitor binds somewhere else and disables the enzyme no matter what is bound, so Vmax falls and nothing recovers it. Uncompetitive inhibitors bind only the enzyme-substrate complex, so both constants fall in proportion — on a Lineweaver-Burk plot their lines run parallel. Read the panel while switching classes: the geometry tells you the class.',

        'This is not abstract pharmacology. Methanol poisoning kills because alcohol dehydrogenase converts methanol into formaldehyde and formic acid; fomepizole (or traditionally, ethanol) is simply a competitive inhibitor of that enzyme, chosen so methanol sits unprocessed while the kidney excretes it. Allopurinol competitively inhibits xanthine oxidase; ACE inhibitors mimic the transition state of angiotensin I. The therapeutic logic always reduces to the same move: change the apparent constants, change what the body does with the real molecule.',

        'Temperature cuts both ways, and the crossover is clinical. Below about 42°C, Q10 rules: reactions roughly double per 10°C, which is part of why a fever speeds metabolism and why hypothermia protects tissues — slowed enzymes need less oxygen. Above it, denaturation takes over: the protein\'s shape IS its function, and heat unravels the shape faster than kinetic energy speeds the reaction. That is why 41°C accelerates you while 47°C is an emergency, and the same physics underlies malignant hyperthermia and heat stroke.',

      paragraphs: [
        'pH works through ionisation: the charged residues that bind substrate and stabilise the transition state only carry the right charges within a narrow window around the optimum. Push either way and activity falls off steeply — which is what systemic acidaemia does to every enzymatic process at once. It is one reason a pH of 6.9 is an emergency long before any single number explains it: the blood gas looks like one problem, but the patient\'s entire biochemistry is running off-optimum. Watch the residual-activity readout as you drag the pH slider — whole-body acidosis is this graph applied to everything simultaneously.',

      paragraphs: [
        'One habit worth building from this module: when you meet any drug described as an "inhibitor", ask which constant it moves and whether substrate can overcome it clinically. Competitive inhibition is surmountable — dose up or clear the rival. Noncompetitive inhibition is not — you stop the drug or support the patient until new enzyme is synthesised. That single distinction separates drugs you can push through from drugs that poison, and it comes straight off the curve.',
