Note what did not move: Vmax is untouched, because with enough substrate every inhibitor molecule can still be displaced from every site.

This crossover is the whole difference between fever, where modest heat speeds you up, and heat stroke or malignant hyperthermia, where the same physics has passed its tipping point and active cooling becomes the treatment.',

In practice this discrimination is done exactly this way, from apparent constants measured across substrate concentrations — never from watching one reaction run once.',
