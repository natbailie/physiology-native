      'Slowed initiation with shrunken amplitude and a tremor that appears AT rest and quiets on action is parkinsonism — dopamine-depleted gating of movement. Cerebellar tremor is the opposite timing (worse as the target approaches), essential tremor is postural with normal initiation, and chorea invades a normally-initiating system. Micrographia is this module\'s amplitude arithmetic in everyday form.',
