      'Salt-losing crisis plus virilisation is the classic 21-hydroxylase presentation: the block hits cortisol and aldosterone together while diverted flux floods androgens. The 17-OHP marker is enormous because the substrate piles up immediately before the blocked step. Contrast 3β-HSD, which also wastes salt but under-virilises with a low 17-OHP — same crisis, opposite genital finding, different enzyme.',

    explanation:
      'Virilisation with hypertension means DOC — trapped when 11β-hydroxylase fails — provides mineralocorticoid activity that prevents salt-wasing while driving pressure up. Androgens rise exactly as in 21-OH because flux diverts around the block. The pair "high androgens + hypertensive" has only one enzymatic answer; 21-OH gives high androgens with a crashing pressure instead.',
