        'The adrenal cortex is one biochemical assembly line running in three zones. Cholesterol becomes pregnenolone, then the line branches: toward aldosterone (glomerulosa), cortisol (fasciculata), or adrenal androgens (reticularis). Every CAH phenotype is a partial roadblock somewhere on that line, and because ACTH rises when cortisol falls, the gland upstream of the block is flogged harder — so intermediates ACCUMULATE rather than simply disappearing. That single principle explains why 17-hydroxyprogesterone is the newborn screening analyte for 21-hydroxylase deficiency: it is made in abundance and cannot get past the block.',

      paragraphs: [
        '21-hydroxylase deficiency is the commonest form and the pattern to learn first. The block sits where both cortisol AND aldosterone need it, so salt-wasting crisis threatens while the diverted flux pours into androgens — virilised females, precocious puberty in males. Partial blocks spare enough mineralocorticoid to avoid crisis but not enough to stop virilisation: the simple-virilising form is the same enzyme, milder dose. Treatment replaces what is missing and, crucially, suppresses the ACTH drive fuelling the androgen excess — watch crisis risk fall on the treated preset even though endogenous production stays collapsed.',

        'Then compare the rarer blocks, because each inverts part of the picture. 11β-hydroxylase deficiency also diverts toward androgens, but its trapped precursor is DOC — a weak mineralocorticoid that piles up enough to cause HYPERTENSION, which makes salt-wasting impossible. 17α-hydroxylase deficiency is the mirror image entirely: with no pathway to cortisol or androgens, everything floods the mineralocorticoid arm — hypertension WITH absent androgens, undervirilised males, sexually infantile females. And 3β-HSD deficiency knocks out the earliest shared step, so EVERYTHING downstream falls including DHEA-derived androgens — salt-wasting with UNDER-virilisation, and a LOW 17-OHP that distinguishes it biochemically from 21-OH.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Two clinical threads run through all of this. The first is blood pressure: it falls when mineralocorticoids are lost and rises when DOC accumulates, so the same family of enzyme defects produces both salt-losing collapse and early hypertensive disease depending only on WHERE the block sits. The second is treatment as diagnosis: giving hydrocortisone suppresses the ACTH drive fuelling precursor accumulation, so the biochemistry of a treated patient tells you about compliance before it tells you about genetics — watch the treated preset hold normal crisis risk while its endogenous cortisol remains collapsed.',

Boards ask this matrix constantly because it is pure logic once the pathway diagram is in your head — and dangerous to guess, because the presentations overlap at the bedside while the biochemistry never does.',
