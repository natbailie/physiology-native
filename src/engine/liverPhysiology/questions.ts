    explanation:
      'Mild unconjugated jaundice with completely normal enzymes and no bilirubinuria is Gilbert syndrome — a reduced UGT capacity that hides until fasting, illness or exertion raises the load. The conjugated fraction stays low, urobilinogen is normal, and nothing is damaged. It matters clinically almost entirely so that it is not mistaken for something else: no treatment, no monitoring, no restrictions.',

    panel: PANEL,
    settleSeconds: SETTLE,
    explanation:
      'Jaundice with a negative bilirubin dipstick localises the problem upstream of the liver: unconjugated bilirubin is albumin-bound and simply cannot reach the urine. The liver copes by upregulating excretion, so conjugated levels stay low while urobilinogen floods through — the one pattern where high turnover reads as high urinary urobilinogen. The gallstone preset produces deep jaundice too, but its urine is inky and its stool pale.',

    explanation:
      'Conjugated-predominant jaundice with bilirubinuria, absent urobilinogen and pale stools means bile cannot leave the liver — the pigment has nowhere to go but backwards into blood and urine. ALP rises because biliary epithelium responds to pressure, while ALT stays quiet because hepatocytes are unharmed. Pain points to a stone rather than a painless stricture or head-of-pancreas tumour, which can produce an identical chart silently.',
