/**
 * The vertigo workup: spontaneous nystagmus, vertigo, VOR gain, positional nystagmus and
 * Romberg. Between them these place the lesion — one nerve silent, both gone, debris in a
 * canal — and no one of them does it alone. The most disabled patient in the module has the
 * quietest examination, which is why the panel is read whole.
 *
 * A leaf file with type-only imports, and that matters: `questions.ts` pulls values out of
 * the engine, so a case file importing this panel from THERE would drag the whole vestibular
 * engine into the ward-round index that loads on the home page. Both consumers read it here
 * instead, which also means the rows a learner is examined on are the rows the bedside shows
 * them — one definition, not two that agree until somebody edits one.
