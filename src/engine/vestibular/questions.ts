    explanation:
      'Continuous spontaneous nystagmus with severe vertigo means an uncompensated firing imbalance — one nerve has gone quiet and the other\'s resting tone is being read as acceleration. Nystagmus beating left says the right nerve is the silent one. No hearing loss separates neuritis from labyrinthitis; the duration (days, not seconds) separates it from BPPV; the single episode with recovery ahead separates it from Ménière disease.',

    panel: PANEL,

    explanation:
      'Central compensation has suppressed the firing mismatch — no vertigo, no visible nystagmus — but it cannot rebuild the dead nerve: the VOR gain remains low, so quick head turns outrun the eye movement and the world smears. This dissociation between how the patient feels and what the mechanics do is why a head impulse belongs in every follow-up, and why vestibular rehabilitation rather than reassurance is the treatment.',

    explanation:
      'Bilateral vestibular loss destroys the comparison itself — no imbalance, therefore no vertigo and no nystagmus, however disabled the patient. Oscillopsia with head motion and darkness-dependent ataxia are the signatures: vision was substituting for the missing otolith input. Aminoglycoside toxicity is the classic cause because the drug concentrates in vestibular hair cells; the most disabled patient in the module has the quietest examination.',

The canals report change, not steady state, which is why skaters spot their turns in stages rather than feeling them continuously.

The direction reverses relative to during the spin, and it fades over the following seconds as the endolymph settles. Drunk drivers fail the finger-nose test for the same reason: alcohol changes endolymph density, making the cupula respond to gravity as if the head were always turning.',

What it does not do is restore the VOR gain, which stays low until (if ever) the nerve recovers; that residual shows up as oscillopsia on quick turns and a positive head impulse. Rehabilitation works by accelerating exactly this process, not by healing the nerve.',
