 * Mean corpuscular volume of newly produced cells, fL — the classifier.

 * The two deficiencies push cell size in OPPOSITE directions, and the reason is a race between
 * nucleus and cytoplasm:
 *
 * - Without IRON, haemoglobin accumulates too slowly. The precursor keeps dividing while it
 *   waits to reach its haemoglobin threshold, so it ends up small — MICROCYTIC.
 * - Without B12 or FOLATE, DNA synthesis stalls while the cytoplasm matures on schedule. The
 *   cell cannot divide on time and is released oversized — MACROCYTIC.
 *
 * That single opposition is what makes MCV the first branch point in classifying an anemia.
