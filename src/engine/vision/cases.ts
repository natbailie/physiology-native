/**
 * Four beds in two mirror pairs.
 *
 * Retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration fail in opposite illuminations; acute and
 * open-angle glaucoma destroy the same end organ at opposite tempos. Each pair looks alike
 * at first glance and divides on the panel into opposite managements — which is the whole
 * reason the module keeps three panels instead of one. Nothing here is new physiology; what
 * is new is that the numbers belong to somebody, which is the difference between reading a
 * panel and deciding what to do next.
 *
 * Observations are absent on purpose. Each `chart` points at its panel, so the rows are read
 * off the settled engine at the bedside and checked against it in `cases.test.ts`.

The single most useful question in a visual history is often which light exposes the disability — night failure with spared reading points here, while Eleanor in the next bed shows the exact mirror.

    teaching:
      'Poor acuity in bright light with preserved night mobility points at the cone mosaic — a macular problem, where the optics are innocent and no lens can refocus a failing sensor. The pupils stay equal and reactive because the lesion sits distal to the reflex arc, and perceived brightness reads low even in a bright scene because the retina cannot read the light that is there. Tom next door is the mirror image: his daylight task survives while the night defeats him. Magnifiers and light buy function; nothing here buys back the mosaic.',
