/**
 * The haemodynamic panel: output, both filling pressures, resistance, and the two oxygen
 * numbers. Between them these name the cause; no one of them does it alone.
 *
 * A leaf file with type-only imports, and that matters: `questions.ts` pulls `perturbFluidBolus`
 * out of the engine, so a case file importing this panel from THERE would drag the whole shock
 * engine into the ward-round index that loads on the home page. Both consumers read it here
 * instead, which also means the rows a learner is examined on are the rows the bedside showed
 * them — one definition, not two that agree until somebody edits one.
