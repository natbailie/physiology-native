 * debt is a threshold — tissue simply extracts more until it cannot, and only then goes into debt.
 * Regional production starts sooner: the vasoconstriction defending arterial pressure is itself
 * shutting beds down, and they go anaerobic while the global numbers still balance. See
 * `LACTATE.REGIONAL_THRESHOLD_DRIVE`.
 *
 * A bed starves for either of two reasons, so the regional term takes the WORSE of them: the
 * reflex has diverted its flow away, or there is not enough flow to divert. Keying it to reflex
 * drive alone left the `decompensating` preset — a patient at MAP 38 with the reflex removed —
 * reporting a normal lactate, which is the one thing that state cannot have.
