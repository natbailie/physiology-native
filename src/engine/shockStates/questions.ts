    settleSeconds: SETTLE,
    explanation:
      'Both filling pressures are empty and the resistance is up — there is simply not enough blood in the circuit, and the circulation has clamped down to compensate. Note the mixed venous saturation: it is low because extraction is intact and the tissue is taking everything it can from a reduced delivery. That is the opposite of the septic pattern. Note also the blood pressure, which is close to acceptable while the cardiac index is not. Compensation is hiding the severity, and it will keep hiding it until it fails.',

    explanation:
      'Low output with both filling pressures raised is a pump that cannot clear what reaches it. The high wedge is the blood damming back into the lungs, which is what is making the patient breathless, and the raised CVP follows because a congested pulmonary circulation loads the right heart in turn. This is the state where a fluid bolus makes matters worse: filling was never the problem, and adding volume simply pushes the wedge higher.',

    settleSeconds: SETTLE,
    explanation:
      'Output is high, resistance is on the floor, and the mixed venous saturation is high — alongside a markedly raised lactate. That combination only makes sense one way: oxygen is being delivered in abundance and returned unused, because the tissue cannot extract it. The team should not be reassured. A high SvO₂ is reassuring only next to a normal lactate, and here the lactate is doing the talking. Treatment is vasopressors and source control, not more inotropy.',

    explanation:
      'The CVP is high and the output is low, exactly as in cardiogenic shock — and then the wedge is low, which settles it. The obstruction sits between the two measurements: blood is dammed on the right because it cannot cross the lungs, so very little reaches the left heart to raise the wedge.

This is why hypotension in haemorrhage is a late sign: by the time the pressure falls, the compensation has already been exhausted, and a great deal of blood has already gone.',
