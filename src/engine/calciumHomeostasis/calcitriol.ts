 * Target calcitriol (active vitamin D) level (0..1). PTH stimulates renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase,

 * tissue. Because this final activation step happens in the kidney, renal failure breaks it
 * regardless of how much vitamin D was ingested or how hard PTH drives — which is why CKD
 * patients need calcitriol analogues rather than plain vitamin D supplementation.
