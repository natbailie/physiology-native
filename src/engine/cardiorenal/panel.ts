/**
 * The cardiorenal observation set: what the heart is managing, what the kidney is making of it,
 * and how hard the hormones are working to keep the pressure up.
 *
 * Authored here rather than lifted from `questions.ts`, which is the one difference from the
 * other modules with beds: cardiorenal's six questions are all predict-then-run, so this module
 * has never had a panel to share. The rows are chosen on the same rule the pattern panels use —
 * no single one of them names the problem, and the combination does. Output and pressure
 * separate a failing pump from a failing kidney only once RAAS is read alongside them.
 *
 * Four of these rows do not carry the units a bedside chart would assume, and the engine says so
 * itself: `references.ts` records that `gfr`, `urineOutput` and `bloodVolume` are NORMALISED —
 * 100 is normal, not mL/min — and `derived.cardiacOutput` is mL/min, not L/min.
 *
 * Printed against the units they used to claim, that gave "2707.7 L/min" and "109.36 L" on
 * Margaret's chart. GFR hid for longer because a normal GFR really is about 100 mL/min, so the
 * baseline looked right and only the ill beds were wrong; urine never did, since 100 mL/min is
 * 144 litres a day. Percent is what the engine actually computes, so percent is what is shown.
 *
 * Every comparison in `caseSuite` and `verifyPattern` divides by the larger magnitude, so a
 * row scaled by a constant marks identically and a relabelled row does not move at all.
