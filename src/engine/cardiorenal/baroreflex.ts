/**
 * Target baroreflex drive: normalized -1..1 signal from how far the given MAP is
 * below (positive) or above (negative) the setpoint. Positive drive means
 * "sympathetic activation" — raise heart rate and vascular tone to restore pressure.
 * The engine relaxes the actual (smoothed) drive toward this target on
 * BAROREFLEX.TAU_SECONDS rather than snapping to it.
 *
 * Measured against the CURRENT setpoint, which resets slowly toward the prevailing pressure, so
 * this defends against a CHANGE in pressure rather than against a level.
 *
 * SATURATING in the error, not linear in it. The reflex has most of its gain close to the
 * setpoint, which is where a patient lives and where a controller has to do its work; a linear ramp
 * out to 40 mmHg put nearly all of the gain in territory nobody survives. Symmetric, because this
 * reflex also has to slow a heart when pressure runs high.
