    explanation:
      'The fall in cardiac output is read by the baroreceptors and the kidney as underfilling, so RAAS activates and retains salt and water. Blood volume climbs. The tragedy of the mechanism is that it is calibrated for haemorrhage, where more volume genuinely helps — but a weak ventricle cannot use the extra preload, so the volume accumulates as congestion while the pressure never fully normalises. This is the cardiorenal syndrome, and it is why diuretics rather than fluids are the treatment.',

    explanation:
      'A kidney that cannot excrete the daily sodium and water load lets blood volume expand, and the expanded volume raises cardiac output and therefore pressure. RAAS compounds it: the failing kidney reads its own low filtration as underperfusion and keeps signalling for more retention even as the pressure climbs. This is why hypertension is near-universal in CKD, and why it is treated with salt restriction and RAAS blockade rather than with agents that simply dilate.',

    // expanded volume to show up as pressure, and the baroreflex opposes the rise while it happens.
    // Its three siblings below already watch for 1200 s; at the default 600 this one caught the
    // excursion mid-climb and the harness rightly called it too small to see.

    explanation:
      'It falls, and it falls precisely because the reflex is working. Vasoconstriction defends the mean arterial pressure by raising resistance, and the kidney is one of the beds being constricted to do it — perfusion pressure is preserved at the cost of perfusion. This is the mechanism behind pre-renal acute kidney injury, and it is why a normal blood pressure in a bleeding patient is not reassurance about their kidneys.

    explanation:
      'Volume rises, because sodium is what water follows. The kidney will eventually excrete the extra load and reach a new steady state, but it does so at a higher volume and a higher pressure — pressure natriuresis is the mechanism, and raising the pressure is how it works rather than a side effect of it. That is the whole of the salt-and-hypertension argument in one loop: the kidney does not fail to handle the salt, it handles it at a cost.',

      'It rises, because the failing kidney senses poor delivery and cannot distinguish it from hypovolaemia. So it activates the very system designed to correct a low volume — retaining salt and water and constricting vessels in a patient who is already overloaded. The loop is closed the wrong way round, which is why renal disease causes hypertension rather than merely accompanying it, and why blocking this axis is the mainstay of treating it.',

This is cardiorenal syndrome, and the important part is that it is a mechanism rather than a correlation: the kidney is not injured, it is underperfused, and it will recover if the output does. It is also why treating the rising creatinine as a renal problem — by giving fluid, say — makes a congested patient worse.',
