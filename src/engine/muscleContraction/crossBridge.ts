 * a large rise in activation, so the muscle behaves as a switch rather than a rheostat.
 *
 * In skeletal and cardiac muscle this is calcium binding to troponin-C, moving tropomyosin off
 * the myosin binding sites. In smooth muscle there is no troponin at all — calcium binds
 * calmodulin, which activates myosin light chain kinase, which phosphorylates the myosin head.
 * Different molecules, same shape of curve, and the same place in the causal chain.
