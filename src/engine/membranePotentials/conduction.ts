/**
 * Conduction velocity (m/s). Myelination is the dominant term — saltatory conduction between
 * nodes of Ranvier is what makes a myelinated fiber an order of magnitude faster than an
 * unmyelinated one of the same diameter. Sodium channel availability matters too, since each
 * node needs enough inward current to depolarize the next, and cooling slows everything via
 * the same Q10 that governs gating.
 *
 * Demyelination slows or blocks propagation without preventing the axon from generating an
 * action potential at all — the distinction between a conduction problem and an excitability one.
