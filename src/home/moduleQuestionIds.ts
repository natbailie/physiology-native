/**
 * Every module's question ids, discovered rather than listed.
 *
 * The home screen needs to know how many questions each module HAS, not just how many the
 * learner has attempted — mastery counts the unseen ones against you, so the denominator has to
 * be the whole module.
 *
 * Generated rather than hand-maintained on purpose. Module ids already appear in four places (see
 * CLAUDE.md) and a fifth that silently under-reports a module's size would be the least visible
 * of them: nothing would break, the numbers would just quietly be wrong. This used to be an
 * `import.meta.glob`; it is now `modules/manifest.generated.ts`, which nobody edits by hand and
 * which `manifest.generated.test.ts` re-globs to prove still covers every module. That swap is
 * what lets the React Native app share this file — Metro has no glob and Hermes rejects
 * `import.meta` outright. `moduleQuestionIds.test.ts` still asserts the index finds every module
 * in the registry, so if discovery breaks it fails loudly rather than reporting zero.
 *
 * The loaders are deliberately NOT eager. Eagerly importing them welds every module's questions
 * into the chunk that imports this file — fine while App.tsx statically imported all pages, fatal
 * to first-load size now that each page is its own lazy route. The index builds once in the
 * background; consumers subscribe and re-render when it lands.
