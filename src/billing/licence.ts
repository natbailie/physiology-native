/**
 * Institutional licence codes.
 *
 * This replaces the old `accessCode.ts`, which held an unlock in localStorage and checked it
 * against a constant compiled into the bundle. That was a back door by construction — anyone who
 * opened devtools could read the code — and it could not express the things a real licence needs:
 * a seat count, an expiry, and which school is paying.
 *
 * A seat now lives in Postgres. Redemption goes through the `redeem_licence` rpc, which takes a
 * row lock before counting seats so two students claiming the last one cannot both get it, and
 * enrols the student in the licence's cohort when it names one. The browser stores nothing: what
 * this module returns is a report of what the server did.
