/**
 * What the tutor is told, and what it is given to answer from.

 * assembled on the client because that is where the corpus and the progress store already are.
 *
 * Nothing assembled here is trusted as instruction. The function fences it and says so; the worst
 * a learner can do by tampering with their own request is give themselves a worse answer, since
 * there are no tools behind this and no other learner's data within reach.
