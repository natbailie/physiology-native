/**
 * What the learner is looking at right now, for the tutor to read.
 *
 * The tutor already knows which module is open, what the app has written about it, and what the
 * learner keeps getting wrong. What it could not see until now is the screen: the numbers the
 * simulation is currently producing. Without them "why is my MAP falling?" can only be answered
 * in general terms, because the model has no idea what the MAP actually is.
 *
 * The readouts are not re-derived here. A module already declares its tiles as `ReadoutSpec`s and
 * `ReadoutGridView` already formats each one to the string on screen, so this stores the same
 * strings rather than a second opinion about them — the tutor and the tile cannot disagree.
 *
 * ## Why a module-level store rather than a context
 *
 * `ChatLauncher` mounts in `App.tsx` as a SIBLING of the routed page, not a descendant, so no
 * provider a module page could mount would reach it. This is the same shape as `progressStore`
 * and the `configuredFor` latch in both `revenuecat.ts` files: one process-wide slot, written by
 * whoever owns the screen, read by whoever needs it.
 *
 * ## Why a closure rather than a value
 *
 * The engine loop re-renders at frame rate. Storing the formatted lines on every frame would
 * spend real work sixty times a second on a question that is asked, at most, once a minute — so
 * what is stored is a FUNCTION that will compute them, and it is called only when a message is
 * actually sent. Publishing costs one assignment.
 *
 * Read with `readLiveState()`, which is a plain call and deliberately not a hook: nothing should
 * re-render because a number changed.
