/**
 * A patient: one scenario a module can already produce, given a name and a reason to care.
 *
 * The ward round is not a new kind of content. Every case here points at a preset the module
 * has had all along, and the questions it collects are the ones already written against it —
 * what a case adds is the history, the task and the payoff, which is the half a simulator
 * cannot infer. `shockStates`' haemorrhagic preset was documented as "a compensated Class III
 * bleed whose pressure still reads acceptable over a collapsed cardiac index" long before
 * anybody thought of the ward round; that sentence is a patient waiting for a name.
 *
 * Three rules hold this honest, and each is enforced rather than asked for:
 *
 * - **Observations are never written down.** `chart` is a list of ACCESSORS onto the settled
 *   simulation, the same `PanelField` rows the module's pattern questions are marked against.
 *   A case therefore cannot claim a MAP of 62 while the engine settles at 78, which is the one
 *   failure that would make the bedside a lie. `caseSuite.ts` reads the chart through the real
 *   engine and refuses a patient whose observations do not separate them from a healthy one.
 * - **Acuity is not authored.** How urgent a bed is depends on what THIS learner has forgotten,
 *   so it is derived from spaced-repetition state at render time — see `acuity.ts`. A hand-typed
 *   acuity would be stale the moment somebody answered a question.
 * - **A case adds no state.** Everything the round knows it reads from the progress store that
 *   already exists. There is no case table, no round record and no schema change.
