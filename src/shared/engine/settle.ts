/**
 * Opening a module on its resting physiology — the state AND the trace.
 *
 * Two things used to happen in the first seconds of every module, and both read as the instrument
 * warming up rather than as a patient lying still. The readouts climbed, because a fresh
 * `createInitialState()` starts every reflex and hormone actuator at zero and is a plausible
 * starting point rather than a steady state. And the chart swept, because history began empty: a
 * `Sparkline` normalises x against the points it HAS, so two points draw a line across the whole
 * frame and every tick after that compresses it leftwards until the buffer is full.
 *
 * Settling fixed the first for the 34 modules that declare `settleSeconds`. This fixes the second
 * for all of them, by recording the tail of the settle instead of throwing it away, so a module
 * opens on a full trace of the resting state it is already showing.
 *
 * Deliberately pure, deliberately free of React and of anything browser-only: this is the one
 * implementation, file-synced into the native app, so the phone and the web open identically.

 * The structural subset of a loop config this needs. Stated here rather than imported so that the

 * The step the settle takes, and how much of it is kept as the opening trace.
 *
 * The step size is the whole of the point. The live loop sub-steps at
 * `min(maxDtSeconds, frame * timeScale)` — smaller than `maxDtSeconds` for half the modules — and
 * an engine can be sensitive to which. muscleContraction is the worked example: settled in its 33ms
 * chunks it holds a tension of 9.6, and the moment the loop takes over at 0.8ms sub-steps that
 * relaxes to 0.12. At its `timeScale` of 0.05 the drop takes five real seconds, so an unstimulated
 * muscle opened with a tension that visibly fell away. That is the artefact this file exists to
 * remove, and it is not caused by the settle being too short.
 *
 * So the settle runs at the loop's own step from the first chunk to the last. The module hands over
 * already holding the state the loop will maintain, and the total simulated time is still exactly
 * `settleSeconds` — which is what keeps the promise that what a learner reads on load is the state
 * the verification harness checks, rather than a scenario that has quietly run on further.
